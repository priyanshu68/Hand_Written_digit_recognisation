# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks

This project utilizes neural networks to recognize and classify handwritten digits. It includes Jupyter Notebook files for training a digit recognition model, testing the model using custom digit images, and a pre-trained Keras model for immediate use.

## Files

1. **Handwritten Digit Recognitions using Neural Networks.ipynb**:
   - Jupyter Notebook containing code for training the digit recognition model using neural networks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

2. **Handwritten Digit Model.ipynb**:
   - Jupyter Notebook containing code for testing the trained model using custom digit images. It loads the pre-trained Keras model and performs predictions on custom images from the 'digits' folder.

3. **handwritten_digit_model.keras**:
   - Pre-trained Keras model saved for immediate use in digit recognition tasks. The model has been trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset.

4. **digits/**:
   - Folder containing custom digit images for testing the model. Users can add their own digit images to this folder for testing purposes.

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**:
   - Open and run the 'Handwritten Digit Recognitions using Neural Networks.ipynb' notebook in a Jupyter environment to train the digit recognition model. Follow the instructions within the notebook for data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

2. **Testing with Custom Images**:
   - Add your custom digit images to the 'digits' folder.
   - Open and run the 'Handwritten Digit Model.ipynb' notebook to load the pre-trained model and perform predictions on the custom images. Follow the instructions within the notebook for loading the model, preprocessing images, and making predictions.
